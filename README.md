# Capturing full sized images using fileprovider

This is a demo project to explain the use case capturing full sized camera photos and not just the thumnail.

We will create and store a file on the device and then pass itâ€™s URI to the default camera application via intent.
Now after clicking a picture, the camera app will then process the file internally, and save a full-size photo into it.
